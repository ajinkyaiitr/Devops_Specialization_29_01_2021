Benefits of Devops:
1)Rapid Delivery
2)Reliability
3)Scale
4)Speed
5)Better Collaboration
6)Security

Development Phases:
1)Plan 
2)Code
3)Build
4)Test
5)Release

Operation Phases:
1)Release
2)Deploy
3)Operate
4)Monitor

Planning Phase:
Planning phase involves a shorter goal planning. A
scrum or agile planning is a better choice. The
various tools you use are:
1. Microsoft Office, Google Docs / Sheet
2. Project Management Tools - Microsoft Project
3. Task Management tools - Asana, Jira, Mantis

Coding Phase:
1. Text Editors and Integrated Dev Environments:
a. Sublime, Vim, Emacs ...
b. Eclipse, XCode, Visual Studio...

GIT
Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in
source code during software development. It is designed for
coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track
changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and
support for distributed, non-linear workflows


Build
Build process involves compiling code, copying the
assets, generating config and documentation. It should
also work on developer machine as well as on
unattended machine.
There are various build tools:
1. Maven, Ant, SBT etc..

Testing
Testing involves verifying if the code is performance as
per requirement. Unit Testing starts at coding time.
Write test cases before you code.
Various Types: Manual, Unit testing, Integration, Stress
testing.
Tools: xUnit, Selenium, Scripts

Release
Once the testing has been successfully done, the build
is released as RC (release candidate) which is ready for
being deployed in production.
Tools like Jenkins are used for releasing. Also, Apache
Maven repositories are also used for releasing the
binaries.

Deploy
Once the release is finalized, we can deploy it using
different automation tools:
Puppet, Chef, Ansible, SaltStack
Newer tools such as Docker and Kubernetes help scale
infinitely and instantaneously.
Docker and Kubernetes are used in testing too these
days in CI.


Operate
Once the software is in production, users can use it
and the product managers can customize it. During the
"operating" phase, we can measure the effectiveness
using A/B Testing. 

Monitor
We also need to monitor the various system resource
consumptions such as Nagios.
We must also monitor the various logs and errors
being thrown by the system.
See: Apache Logging System
Visualization tools such as Grafana are used to
represent metrics.


Demo commands:
mkdir devops
cd devops

Initializing git repository
git init

Listing all files
ls -a

Adding python file
git add helloworld.py

Commiting the git
git commit -m "This is hello World"

Seeing the status:
git log
git status

Seeing the difference:
git diff
